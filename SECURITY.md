# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the TSA tooling or reference implementation, please report it privately:

- Email: jase.lovell@me.com
- Subject: "TSA security report" (please include a brief summary)

Please avoid opening public issues for security reports.

## Response Expectations

This project is maintained as a personal, best-effort effort alongside a full-time role. I do not provide guaranteed response times, but I will do my best to acknowledge reports and coordinate fixes or advisories when feasible.

## Non-Security Feedback

For RFC/spec feedback, general questions, or implementation discussion, please use GitHub Discussions.
